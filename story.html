<h1>CHEESE PRODUCTION IN THE U.S.</h1>

<p>America loves cheese. In 2009, McDonald’s bought <a href="http://chicago.eater.com/2011/4/29/6683657/burgers-by-the-numbers-mcdonalds">213 million pounds</a> of cheese. There’s national holidays dedicated to cheese– national cheese lover’s day (Jan. 20, 2018), national grilled cheese day (April 12, 2017) and more. There’s blogs, social media pages and trends even dedicated to our favorite food. On Instagram, there are 5,223 photos filed under the hashtag “#cheesepull.”</p>

<p>In 2015 the U.S. produced 22,802,766,000 pounds of cheese.The average American eats 630 pounds of dairy products a year. According to the United States Census Bureau, there were around 320,917,656 U.S. citizens on July 4, 2015, which means, around 36,194,866 pounds of that cheese was consumed in 2015. The production of cheese requires care of the animals, processing, transportation and more, and these activities produce greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane.Cheese production all starts with milk. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, in Feb. 2017, the U.S. produced 15.7 billion pounds of milk.</p>
